##  Overview

LaLiga Fantasy Web is a feature-rich application for managing your La Liga Fantasy teams. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an intuitive interface for team management, player trading, market analysis, and real-time league tracking.

### 💡 Why this application?

The official La Liga Fantasy only has a mobile application, leaving PC users without an optimized native experience. This application fills that gap by offering:

- **PC-optimized interface**: Takes advantage of large screens and keyboard/mouse navigation
- **Additional information**: Market data and probable lineups not available in the official app
- **Enhanced experience**: Additional features for more efficient team management

## 🔐 Privacy and Security

**🛡️ Your data is completely secure:**

- **No own servers / local session data**: Preferences and session are saved locally on your device; they never leave it
- **No telemetry**: We don't send any personal data to external servers
- **No tracking**: The application doesn't track your activity or usage
- **No analytics**: We don't collect usage statistics or personal information
- **Open source**: You can review the source code to verify our transparency
- **Tokens and OAuth**: OAuth tokens (Azure B2C/Google) are stored locally and only sent to provider endpoints for login and session refresh.
- **Data deletion**: From "Log out", tokens and local session data are deleted.

The application only connects to the official LaLiga Fantasy API to obtain public game data from your league and also uses data from https://www.futbolfantasy.com to read market trends data and probable lineups. We never send your credentials, personal configurations, or browsing data to third parties.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher (CI and Docker use Node 20)
- **npm** 7.0.0 or higher
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Externoak/LaLigaApp.git
   cd LaLigaApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start a unified server on port 3005 that includes:

   - CORS proxy server for the LaLiga Fantasy API

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3005` to access the application

   **📱 Mobile device access**: The application displays the local network URL on startup (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:3005`). Use this URL to access from your mobile phone or other devices on the same network. The interface is optimized for mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies

### Frontend
- **[React 18](https://reactjs.org/)** - Component-based UI library
- **[React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/)** - Client-side routing
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lightweight animations** - In-house shim (`motionShim`), no external animation library
- **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/)** - Data fetching and caching

### State Management
- **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)** - Lightweight state management
- Persistent storage for authentication and preferences
- Real-time updates and synchronization

### Build Tools
- **[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)** - Development and build tooling
- **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** - Desktop application framework

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start React development server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm test` | Run test suite |
| `npm run dev` | Start development environment with proxy |
| `npm run server` | Start CORS proxy server only |
| `npm run electron:dev` | Run Electron in development mode |

### Environment Setup

The application uses a unified server that serves both the React application and the CORS proxy:

- **Unified Server**: `http://localhost:3005`
- **API Target**: `https://fantasy-api.llt-services.com`

### Authentication

The app uses OAuth2 with La Liga's Azure B2C tenant:
- **One-click Google login** (desktop app): opens LaLiga's official login window, you sign in, and the app captures your session automatically — no manual token copying
- Google OAuth for social login
- Email/password authentication
- JWT token management with automatic refresh
- Persistent session storage

## 🎨 Customization

### Theming

The application supports comprehensive theming through Tailwind CSS:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          // Custom green palette
          50: '#f0f9f0',
          500: '#2d7d2d',
          900: '#123412',
        },
        dark: {
          // Dark mode colors
          bg: '#0f172a',
          card: '#1e293b',
          border: '#334155',
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Component Structure

All components follow a consistent pattern:
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript-ready (JSDoc comments)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels)

## 🔐 Security

- **Token Security**: JWT tokens stored securely with automatic refresh
- **CORS Protection**: Proxy server validates origins
- **Input Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data logging in production
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforcement for API calls
